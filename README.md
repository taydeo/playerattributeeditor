# PlayerAttributeEditor
Plugin to change player stats with permission nodes.

## Why did I make this?

Firstly, most other plugins I searched do not offer a simple functionality without a ridiculus GUI, unnessacary features,
and forced RPG leveling. I was frustrated, so I legitmately said F*** it, I'm gonna make my own plugin.

## How do I compile from source?

Easy, just clone the repo, and run mvn install.

## Can I clone it?

Of course, its github lol

## Where can I get support?

Join my Discord server, https://discord.gg/tPuQDtS

## Can I help you make updates?

Make a fork, request a merge, and I'll see if I'l allow it.
